# PICOS Progress Report 04: Project Handover & Post-Mortem
**Status:** Transitioning to Fresh Install / Briefing for AI Thought Partner
**Date:** 2025-12-17

## 1. Executive Summary of Final State
The initial attempt at building PICOS resulted in a "Soft-Locked" networking state. While the Proxmox repositories and some core tools (Tailscale, wpasupplicant) were successfully installed, the underlying Debian networking configuration became fragmented. 
* **Key Lesson:** Do NOT attempt to configure `hostapd` or `vmbr1` (the Wi-Fi bridge) until AFTER the Proxmox Kernel is installed and the system has been rebooted.
* **Hardware Warning:** The Wi-Fi card (`wlp1s0`) is sensitive to "Managed" vs "Master" mode switches.

## 2. Instructions for the "Next AI" (Thinking Model)
When restarting this task tomorrow, follow these tactical constraints:
1.  **Prioritize SSH:** Use the iPhone USB tether (`enx...`) immediately to get an IP. Do all work via SSH to avoid TTY font confusion (`l` vs `1`).
2.  **Hostname First:** Ensure `/etc/hosts` is set before `apt install proxmox-ve`.
3.  **Tailscale as Backdoor:** Install Tailscale early. It is the most reliable way to maintain a connection when the local Wi-Fi bridges inevitably go down during configuration.
4.  **Avoid Manual hostapd:** Use Proxmox's native networking stack or a dedicated LXC container for the TV's Access Point instead of forcing it on the host's physical TTY.

## 3. Installed Packages to Re-Install Tomorrow
* `proxmox-ve` (The goal)
* `tailscale` (The lifeline)
* `wpasupplicant` & `iw` (The Wi-Fi controllers)
* `adb` (For the final TV sideload)

## 4. Final System State for Resume
* **OS:** Debian 12 (Bookworm)
* **Hardware:** Laptop with Intel Wi-Fi (`iwlwifi` driver)
* **Network Target:** `Omarcus` (Home Wi-Fi)
* **Recovery Device:** iPhone via USB Tethering
