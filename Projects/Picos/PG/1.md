# PICOS Progress Report 01: Recovery & System Baseline
**Status:** Recovering from Network Lock / Preparing for Proxmox Phase 2
**Date:** 2025-12-17

## 1. Executive Summary of Deviations
The project deviated significantly from the original "Phase 2" plan due to an attempt to create a Wi-Fi Access Point (hostapd) before the Hypervisor was fully established. This resulted in:
* **Hardware Lockout:** The wireless card (`wlp1s0`) was moved into "Master" mode, causing "Device or resource busy" errors during SSH attempts.
* **TTY Blindness:** Due to limited scrollback on the physical laptop screen, troubleshooting became a "blind" process.
* **Typo Loops:** The terminal font made it difficult to distinguish between `l` (lowercase L) and `1` (one), leading to "No such device" errors when targeting `wlp1s0`.

## 2. Infrastructure & Packages Installed
Despite the setbacks, the following core components are now confirmed installed on the PICOS laptop:
* **Network Tools:** `iw`, `wireless-tools`, `wpasupplicant`.
* **Remote Management:** `tailscale` (Installed via curl script).
* **Core Dependencies:** `wget`, `curl`, `apt-transport-https`.

## 3. Step-by-Step Reflection
| Step | Action Taken | Result |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **01** | iPhone USB Tethering | Successful. Established `enxfa428808567a` as the primary internet gateway. |
| **02** | hostapd Configuration | **FAILED.** Created "Match already configured" conflict on the Wi-Fi driver. |
| **03** | Interface Mode Reset | Attempted `iw dev wlp1s0 set type managed`. Failed due to syntax typos (`wlpls0`). |
| **04** | Package Recovery | Ran `apt update`. Successfully fetched Debian and Proxmox metadata. |
| **05** | Tailscale Deployment | Successfully downloaded and began installation to bypass iPhone Hotspot isolation. |

## 4. Current Blockers
* **Identity Confusion:** Identifying the difference between `1` and `l` in the physical TTY.
* **Hotspot Speed:** iPhone throttling is making package downloads (specifically Tailscale and PVE kernels) significantly slower than expected.

## 5. Next Immediate Action
Establish a successful Tailscale connection to move from the physical keyboard to a Copy/Paste SSH environment on Laptop 2.
