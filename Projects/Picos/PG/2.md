# PICOS Progress Report 02: Proxmox VE Transformation
**Status:** Installing Hypervisor Core / Kernel Swap
**Date:** 2025-12-17

## 1. Executive Summary of Deviations
This phase marks the return to the original project roadmap. 
* **Network Pivot:** We abandoned the "Router-First" approach in favor of "Host-First" connectivity.
* **Tethering Reliance:** We are currently using the iPhone USB interface (`enx...`) as the primary repository gateway to avoid the unstable Wi-Fi state.
* **Kernel Priority:** Instead of fixing Wi-Fi drivers now, we are installing the Proxmox Kernel first, as it includes its own updated driver stack which may resolve the "Busy" errors natively.

## 2. Infrastructure & Packages Installed
* **Repositories:** Proxmox Bookworm No-Subscription repository added to `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/`.
* **Security:** Proxmox Release GPG key added to trusted keys.
* **Kernel:** `proxmox-default-kernel` (Replacing standard Debian 6.1 kernel).
* **System Tools:** `postfix` (set to Local Only), `open-iscsi`.

## 3. Step-by-Step Reflection
| Step | Action Taken | Result |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2.1** | Hostname Correction | Updated `/etc/hosts` to map `127.0.1.1` to `picos`. Verified via `hostname --ip-address`. |
| **2.2** | Repo Configuration | Injected PVE sources.list. This allowed the system to see PVE-specific packages instead of just Debian ones. |
| **2.3** | System Upgrade | Ran `apt full-upgrade`. This synchronized Debian base packages with Proxmox requirements. |
| **2.4** | Kernel Transplant | Installed `proxmox-default-kernel`. This is the most critical step for stable virtualization (KVM/LXC support). |
| **2.5** | Postfix Setup | Configured as "Local Only" to satisfy Proxmox dependencies without opening external mail ports. |

## 4. Current Blockers
* **Reboot Synchronicity:** The transition from the Debian kernel to the Proxmox kernel requires a reboot, which temporarily breaks the Tailscale/SSH session.
* **Interface Naming:** Proxmox may attempt to rename `wlp1s0` or `enx...` upon rebooting into the new kernel, requiring a quick `ip link` check.

## 5. Next Immediate Action
Finalize the installation of the `proxmox-ve` meta-package and perform the first login to the Web GUI (Port 8006).
